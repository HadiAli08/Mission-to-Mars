#Mission to Mars 

####Description
After looking at pictures of Mars hemispheres, we decided that we wanted to adjust the web app to include these pictures. Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we are going to scrape the full resolution pictures of Mars and the picture titles, store them in a Mongo database and use a web application to display the data.
